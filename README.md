# rag-from-scratch-with-gemini

This Repository is Google Gemini version of [rag-from-scratch with langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch)

Due to OpenAI's API pricing policy, Starter uses only 5$ credit to apply ChatGPI API.  

This policy makes me annoyed. so I find **Free** LLM API in Google [Gen AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) with gemini-1.5

## Get Started
If you start langchain's rag-from-scratch tutorial with google genai stdio with free, You just create google genAi studio API keys and assign that key to `GOOGLE_API_KEY` enviroment variable

```shell
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your api key"
```

And? Feel free to study rag from scratch in gemini with this example repo!!
